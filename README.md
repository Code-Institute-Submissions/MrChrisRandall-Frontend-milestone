PROJECT NAME

"Link With Me" by Christopher Randall

In this project I wanted to create an employee/freelance showcase style website where employers can come and browse through future employees and admire their work and get a feel for the person they may potentially hire.

User Experience (UX)    

    User stories

        First Time Visitor Goals:

         -  As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
         -  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find an employee or freelancer.
         -  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to be able to view the users work.
    
        Returning Visitor Goals:

        -  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the user.
        -  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the user with any questions I may have.
    
        Frequent User Goals:

        -  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added users or content.
        -  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new posts on a users page.

    Design

        Colour Scheme:
        
        -  Three main colours were used on the homepage which were a Blue, Brown and Grey aloing with a clean White for each individual page.
    
        Typography:

        -  The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

        Imagery:

         -  Imagery is important. The split picture is designed to catch the eye of the user. It is also quite modern and pleasing when it closes together once hovered over.

        Hover.css was used on the Profile Picture on the homepage to make the split image realign.

        First Time Visitor Goals:
            
            As a First Time Visitor,  I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

                Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean minimal homepage. Each picture acts as an eye catching interaction and also a link to the users profile.
                The user has two options, click the picture or the users name to be taken to the profile.

            As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find an employee or freelancer.

                The site has been designed to be minimal and clean while incorporating eye catching animations on both th eprofile pictures but also when ther user scrolls down through the page.
                On each profile page there is an email form which is used as a form of contact with the profile owner.

            As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to be able to view the users work.

                Once the new visitor has clicked in to a profile they will be able to then read about the profile owner and also about their past works.
                At the bottom of the profile page there is an email form which is used as a form of contact with the profile owner.
            
        Returning Visitor Goals:

            As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the user with any questions I may have.

                The email form at the end of each profile is the perfect way to contact the profile owner.

        Frequent User Goals:

            As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added users or content.

                This is easily done by scrolling through the homepage.

            As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new posts on a users page.

                This is easily done by finding the user on the homepage and simply clicking into the profile.

    Further Testing:
    
        The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
        The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop nad Mobile.
        A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
        Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
